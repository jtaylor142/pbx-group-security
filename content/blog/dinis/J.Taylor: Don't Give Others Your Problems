Problem Transfer

There is a fine line between delegating tasks in your professional position and transferring responsibility/work tasks to another colleague.  Collaboration is a powerful entity that takes place all of the time in the workplace, but this is also the arena where the transfer can take place.  When you are collaborating with a customer, team member, or another division of the company, and you make the decision to transfer a problem that you know you can solve, it becomes taxing on the other individual or group to solve.  It becomes even more frustrating to others because you likely hold the background knowledge already, and they have to go seek out what you already know.

For example, in project management, the team or the lead oversees a job from start to finish.  When trying to keep everyone abreast of the developments, certain issues will arise and data will need to be collected to confirm or disprove steps in the process. But the key is collecting the data FIRST.  Do not place any parts of the process onto those who are not directly involved in the development.  This greatly slows down the understanding and motivation of other team members.  

Once the data has been collected, analyzed, and trends have been made, the next step is to brainstorm solutions, to keep the process fluid and forward-thinking.  Involving all of the team, both by presenting solutions that can be attained, as well as allowing them to weigh in with their suggestions, keeps the work in-house.  No other entity needs to get involved to solve a problem that the team is more than capable to conquer.  The team can map the problem from start to finish, and that map can and will take on different directions.  However, the bumps and kinks in the road are handled together as a team with no surprises.

Always remember to do tackle a problem head-on and do the due diligence needed to be a productive team member.
